# This is jupyter notebook that predicts prices for properties with the following ml algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- K neighboors
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso
- Bayesian
- Elastic

Before appling the ml algorithms we clean and preprocess the data. After appling the ml algorithms we find the best one.
